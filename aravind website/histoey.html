            <p>The temple and its artwork are a subject of numerous different Tamil legends covered in regional Puranic
                texts. Sriranga Mahathmiyam, for example, is one of the compilation of the temple mythology about its
                origins. According to it, Brahma was performing austerities during the Samudra Manthana (churning of
                cosmic ocean), and Srirangam Vimanam emerged as a result. <br><br> It remained in Satyaloka for ages,
                was brought to Ayodhya by king Ikshvaku. After Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, had killed the evil demon
                Ravana, he gave it to King Vibhishana who wanted to be with Rama. When Vibhishana passed through
                Tiruchi en route to Sri Lanka where he had become the king, the Srirangam Vimanam would not move from
                the island. So, he gave it to a local king called Dharmavarma, if the king consecrated the Vimanam to
                face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence, it is that the deity (in a
                reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis. <br><br> As per another legend,
                Sanaka, the four child sages, came for a darshana of Ranganatha in Srirangam. They were stopped by Jaya
                and Vijaya, the guardians of Vaikuntha. In spite of their pleadings, they were refused entry. In
                anger, all four of them cursed the guardians in one voice and left. The guardians approached Vishnu and
                told him about the curse. Ranganatha said that he would not be able to revert the curse and gave them
                two options: be born as demons opposing Vishnu in three births or good human beings in the following
                seven births. Eager to be back with the Lord, The guardians accepted being demons and are believed to
                have taken the form of Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakasipu; Ravana and Kumbhakarna; and Sisupala and
                Dantavakra. Vishnu assumed four avatars Varaha, Narasimha, Rama, and Krishna, respectively to kill the
                demons in each one of those births.</p>
